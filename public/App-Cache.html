        <h1>My India</h1>
      <p>
        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later
        than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying
        forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly
        diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled
        life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus
        river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
        Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.
