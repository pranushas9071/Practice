      Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than
      55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of
      isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second
      only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the
      subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years
      ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third
